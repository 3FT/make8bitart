# make8bitart

[make8bitart.com](http://make8bitart.com) is a web-based pixel art application that's super fun and easy to use!

## installation

Just download the source and direct your browser to the `index.html` of the project root directory. It's just HTML, JavaScript and CSS, so no need for a special server setup.

## dependencies

make8bitart.com uses jQuery and two jQuery plugins I wrote: [draggybits](https://github.com/jennschiffer/draggybits) and [pixelDiv](https://github.com/jennschiffer/pixelDiv)

## misc notes

8-bit truthers will complain that the color palette is not actually 8-bit. I discuss this on my ["blog"](http://negativitysandwiches.com/making-an-8-bit-color-picker/). If that makes you really angry, then I suggest you take a nap, butthorn.

## made with &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; by jenn schiffer

I designed, built, and created all of the graphics for this passion project. The dinosaur art in the source was found through a variety of geocities websites. 

If you have feature requests, let me know via Twitter (see below). I am currently *not* accepting pull requests. If that makes you really angry, then I suggest you take a nap, butthorn.
